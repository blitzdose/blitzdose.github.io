# Hi, I’m Christian

I take photos, do programming and I am interested in the World of Technology.

I’ve been interested in technology for as long as I can remember. When something didn’t work, I could never just throw it away. I always had to scrape it open, look inside, and try to fix it somehow. Whether it was just a little flashlight or the model car. (By the way, this is still the case)
When I was 14, I started programming little Android apps. I watched YouTube videos for ages and hand-copied the apps. My first “own project” combined all the videos I watched from the playlist. Since then, my projects have become bigger and more complex, and on June 21, 2016, I finally got myself a developer account to publish my apps in the Play Store.
I also always had an interest in photography. On class trips, I always had a small camera with me. My first one was even analog. You can hardly imagine that today. In 2015, I bought a DSLR: the D3200 from Nikon. An entry-level camera and with its quality, it can not quite keep up but I still like to shoot photos with it. Do you want a sample photo? Check out the picture at the top of this page.

# Why “Blitzdose”?

### I have no idea.
I’ve had the name for quite a while. Back in my school days, we made some way to big key chains for like improving our handwork and were supposed to write something on them. Just not our name. For some reason, I came up with the word “blitzdose”, which I used as a username for any platforms from then on. The advantage: This name is NEVER taken. In the meantime, I even designed my own little logo, which you can see in the upper left corner.
